##### Bubble sort

##### Enumerables
Really interesting exercise!  The inject method was difficult to get neat - particularly parsing the parameters. Seems much happier if I cheat and don't try to incorporate the symbol methods.  With a little tweaking there is presumably also scope to DRY out the method by grouping the code that applies either the block or the symbol/string for the operator.
