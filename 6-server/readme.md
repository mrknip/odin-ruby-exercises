## Basic server/browser

A first play around with the nitty-gritty of the HTTP request/response sequence.  Sinatra it ain't.  This exercise has been useful for getting to grips with the structure and sequecning of HTTP interactions. The server/browser combo can happily send and process a simple GET and a simple POST request.

The code is messy and clunky in the extreme - it is yet to be refactored! At this point, though, I can already see the clear benefits that would come with developing independent objects to handle requests, responses, rendering, etc.
