## Some basic first exercises from the Odin project:
#### Caesar cipher
Very brute force and an ugly case switch. There must be a way to make the Enumerable methods do the work, but couldn't quite get there
#### Stock picker
Went to town on this one, playing with modules and such.  I'm sure there are neater ways to do it.
#### Substring
Still need a tidy way of incrementing values in hashes/arrays that are potentially nil - still two lines here
